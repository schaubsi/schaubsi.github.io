I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Visual Inference Lab](https://www.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/) at the Technical University of Darmstadt since September 2020. I obtained my PhD from [ETHZ](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/) in 2018, advised by Prof. Dr. Markus Gross and in collaboration with [Disney Research Zurich](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning with a focus on motion representation, temporal interpolation, and video frame synthesis. Prior to joining TU Darmstadt I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Media Technology Lab](https://mtc.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich working on augmented reality.
